# Pig
Pig dice roll game made using python. Played with a number of people ranging from 2-4 must keep rolling until they have reached a specificed number (in this case, it's 50). Users can enter "y" to keep rolling and "n" to pass the turn to the next player. The catch: If a players roll a 1, their total score goes back to 0 and the turn is automatically passed to another person. The first person to reach 50 wins, but everyone still recieves one more chance to roll again.
